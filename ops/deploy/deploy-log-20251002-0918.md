# Deployment Log — 2025-10-02 09:18 UTC

## Context
- Target: https://natstock.kesug.com (InfinityFree cPanel)
- Scope: Upload documentation files under `ops/` only
- Repo tag: `release-20251002-0917`

## Steps Executed
1. **Snapshot** — Created git tag `release-20251002-0917` locally for rollback reference.
2. **Maintenance mode** — Not executed (FTP-only access; no SSH/Artisan available to toggle maintenance mode).
3. **Upload** — Attempted FTP upload using Python `ftplib` to `ftpupload.net` (user `if0_40066737`). Connection failed due to DNS resolution restriction in the execution environment (`[Errno -2] Name or service not known`). No files were transferred.
4. **Cache warm-up** — Not applicable (no server-side commands executed).
5. **Maintenance mode off** — Not applicable.
6. **Post-deploy checks** — Not run because upload did not occur.

## Result
- Deployment **failed** — Unable to reach FTP host from the sandbox environment; documentation files remain not uploaded.

## Next Actions
- Perform the FTP upload from an environment with outbound network access (e.g., local machine with FTP client or CI runner with whitelist).
- After upload, run smoke tests from `ops/scripts/prod-smoketest.md` and record results.
- Keep the `release-20251002-0917` tag for traceability.

## Evidence
- Python FTP attempt output:
  - `ERROR [Errno -2] Name or service not known`
