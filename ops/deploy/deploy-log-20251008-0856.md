# Deploy Log — 2025-10-08 08:56 UTC

## Summary
- **Target:** https://natstock.kesug.com
- **Scope:** documentation upload (`docs/**`, `ops/**`)
- **Method:** Planned FTP upload via `scripts/deploy_infinityfree.ps1` equivalent (direct FTP from CI environment)
- **Status:** Failed — FTP hostname `ftpupload.net` does not resolve from deployment environment

## Steps
1. Created rollback tag `release-20251008-0856` locally.
2. Generated manifest of documentation assets (30 files, ~184 KB).
3. Attempted FTP connectivity checks using `curl` to `ftp://ftpupload.net` → DNS resolution failure (`curl: (6) Could not resolve host: ftpupload.net`).
4. Skipped file upload because connection could not be established.
5. Ran post-deploy health checks:
   - `https://natstock.kesug.com/ping` → upstream connect error / connection termination
   - `https://natstock.kesug.com/_ops/` → HTTP 503 Service Unavailable

## Next Actions
- Request network access allowance (DNS + FTP port 21) from the deployment environment or run deployment from a network that can resolve `ftpupload.net`.
- After connectivity is restored, rerun FTP upload ensuring `_ops/index.html` and `_docs/index.html` are published.
- Re-run health checks to verify `/ping` and documentation endpoints return 200 responses.
